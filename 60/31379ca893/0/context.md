### Prompt 1

hi ned, what can you do in this framework?

### Prompt 2

what tools you think are useful for you?

### Prompt 3

Web fetch / HTTP requests — So I can pull external data (APIs, RSS feeds, weather, news) from within MCP tools, not just from the outer Claude Code layer. as skill or tool?

### Prompt 4

lets create a web_fetch tool just in case we need to create a skill that fetches data so we use that tool exclusively, makes sense?
