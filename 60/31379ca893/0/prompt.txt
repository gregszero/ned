hi ned, what can you do in this framework?

---

what tools you think are useful for you?

---

Web fetch / HTTP requests — So I can pull external data (APIs, RSS feeds, weather, news) from within MCP tools, not just from the outer Claude Code layer. as skill or tool?

---

lets create a web_fetch tool just in case we need to create a skill that fetches data so we use that tool exclusively, makes sense?
