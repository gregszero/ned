Implement the following plan:

# Add GitHub Actions CI

## Context
OpenFang now has a test suite (169 Ruby tests + 24 Python tests) but no CI pipeline. Adding a GitHub Actions workflow ensures tests run on every push and PR.

## Plan

### Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Single workflow file with two parallel jobs:

**Ruby tests job:**
- Ubuntu latest
- Ruby 3.3 (matches Gemfile `~> 3.3` — use stable 3.3 rather than bleeding-edge 3.4 which has bundled gem issues)
- `ruby/setup-ruby` with `bundler-cache: true` for dependency caching
- `rake test`

**Python tests job:**
- Ubuntu latest
- Python 3.12 (stable)
- `pip install pytest`
- `python3 -m pytest test/python/ -v`

**Triggers:** push to `master`, PRs targeting `master`

### Why this is simple
- SQLite is pre-installed on GitHub runners — no services needed
- No `.env` or API keys required (WebMock blocks real HTTP, jobs are stubbed)
- No Redis, Postgres, or Docker needed
- Both jobs are fully independent

### File created
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## Verification
- Push to GitHub and check Actions tab
- Both jobs should show green
