Implement the following plan:

# Clean Up Canvas Skills — Keep Only Settings + Showcase

## Context
The codebase has accumulated multiple canvas setup skills (`command_center_setup.rb`, `daily_briefing.rb`, `showcase_setup.rb`). The user wants to start fresh with just the settings infrastructure page and the showcase as the main canvas demo.

## Changes

### 1. Delete old skill files
- `skills/command_center_setup.rb` — remove
- `skills/daily_briefing.rb` — remove

### 2. Delete old canvas pages from the database
Run a migration to clean up the dynamic pages created by those skills:
- `workspace/migrations/YYYYMMDDNNNNNN_remove_old_canvas_pages.rb`
- Destroys pages with slugs `command-center` and `daily-briefing` (plus their canvas_components via dependent destroy)
- Leaves infrastructure pages (`jobs`, `heartbeats`, `settings`) and the `showcase` page untouched

### Files kept as-is
- `skills/showcase_setup.rb` — the new showcase skill (just committed)
- `fang/widgets/docker_containers_widget.rb` — new widget (just committed)
- `skills/base.rb` — template/base class

## Verification
1. `./openfang.rb db:migrate` — migration runs, old pages removed
2. Restart server — no errors from missing skills
3. `run_skill showcase_setup` — still works, creates showcase page
4. Sidebar nav no longer shows "Command Center" or "Daily Briefing" pages
