### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Computer Use Agent for OpenFang

## Context

Add an Orgo.ai-style Computer Use Agent. When the AI decides a task needs visual interaction (browsing, clicking, filling forms), it launches a virtual desktop (Xvfb), opens a browser, and streams live screenshots into the OpenFang canvas. The user sees every action happening in real-time. No Docker — runs natively on the host using Xvfb (works both locally and on headless servers via SSH).
