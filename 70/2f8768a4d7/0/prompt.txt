remind me tomorrow morning to check temperature
AI 10:06 PM
I'd be happy to help you set up a reminder, but I don't have the ability to send you notifications or reminders at specific times. Claude Code is a development tool that runs locally and doesn't have access to scheduling or notification systems.

Here are some options to set this reminder:

1. **Use your phone's built-in reminder app** - Set a reminder for tomorrow morning there
2. **Use a calendar app** - Add it as an event for tomorrow morning
3. **System notification** - If you're on Linux (which you are based on the environment), you could use `at` or `cron` to schedule a notification

Would you like me to help you create a simple script that could send a desktop notification tomorrow morning? I could write a one-time scheduled command using `at` that would display a notification on your Linux desktop.
