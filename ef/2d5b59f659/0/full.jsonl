SSE streams (Turbo Stream updates for notifications and canvas pages) hold Puma threads indefinitely, and each thread implicitly holds a DB connection. With `pool: 5` but Puma running 16-32 threads, the pool drains quickly — blocking the scheduler, heartbeats, job queue, and all new HTTP requests.\n\n## Changes\n\n### 1. Increase DB pool size (`config/database.yml`)\n\nChange `pool: 5` → `pool: 32` in the default config to match Puma's max thread count.\n\n### 2. Release DB connections in SSE streams (`web/app.rb`)\n\nWrap the SSE `queue.pop` wait with `ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.release_connection` so the DB connection is returned to the pool while the thread is idle waiting for events. Only check out a connection briefly when actually needed (sending data).\n\n**Before:**\n```ruby\nstream(loop: true, callback: proc { ... }) do |out|\n  html = queue.pop(timeout: 30)\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\n**After:**\n```ruby\nstream(loop: true, callback: proc { ... }) do |out|\n  ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.release_connection\n  html = queue.pop(timeout: 30)\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\nThe `release_connection` call returns the current thread's checked-out connection back to the pool. The next DB query on this thread will transparently check one out again. Since SSE streams spend 99% of their time in `queue.pop` waiting, this frees connections for other threads.\n\n### 3. Add connection cleanup in scheduler (`fang/scheduler.rb`)\n\nAdd `ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.release_connection` in the `rescue`/`ensure` blocks of scheduler jobs to prevent leaked connections from rufus-scheduler threads.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| `config/database.yml` | `pool: 5` → `pool: 32` |\n| `web/app.rb` (~line 63) | Add `release_connection` before `queue.pop` |\n| `fang/scheduler.rb` | Add `ensure` blocks with `release_connection` in scheduler callbacks |\n\n## Verification\n\n1. `rake test` — ensure no regressions\n2. Start locally with `./openfang.rb server`, open multiple browser tabs with SSE connections (canvas pages + notifications)\n3. Check DB pool stats aren't growing: add temporary logging or check via console\n4. Deploy to Ned and confirm stability under normal use\n\n\nIf you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /home/greg/.claude/projects/-home-greg-Developer-openfang/4a011840-f17e-4cfd-a7fa-2022f1ca7205.jsonl"}
