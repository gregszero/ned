Implement the following plan:

# Fix Drag Handle Position & Font Size Movement

## Context

Two bugs from the Nova-style canvas redesign:

1. **Font size moves widget**: `zoom: 0.85`/`1.15` on `.canvas-component` scales the entire element including its CSS `left`/`top` position, causing it to visually shift on the canvas when font size changes.
2. **Drag dots are in the header bar** (inline after title text). User wants them on the **right edge** of the card as a vertical side grip, and dragging should work from anywhere on the component when edit lock is off (not just the dots).

## Fix 1: Font Size — Apply Zoom to Content Only

**Problem**: `zoom` on `.canvas-component` affects the absolute `left`/`top` positioning.

**Fix**: Move `zoom` from `.canvas-component` to `.canvas-component-content` so only the inner content scales, not the component's canvas position or header.

**File**: `web/public/css/style.css` (lines 1151-1153)

```css
/* Before */
.canvas-component.font-sm { zoom: 0.85; }
.canvas-component.font-lg { zoom: 1.15; }

/* After */
.canvas-component.font-sm .canvas-component-content { zoom: 0.85; }
.canvas-component.font-lg .canvas-component-content { zoom: 1.15; }
```

## Fix 2: Drag Handle → Right-Edge Vertical Grip

**Problem**: The 6-dot drag handle is `position: absolute; top-right` but from the screenshot it renders inline in the header. User wants it as a vertical strip on the right edge of the entire card.

### CSS changes (`web/public/css/style.css`)

Restyle `.canvas-drag-handle` as a narrow vertical strip on the right edge, vertically centered:

```css
.canvas-drag-handle {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  right: -1px;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
  z-index: 2;
  padding: 0.5rem 0.25rem;
  border-radius: 0 var(--radius-lg) var(--radius-lg) 0;
  color: var(--muted-foreground);
  opacity: 0;
  cursor: grab;
  transition: opacity 0.15s, background 0.15s;
}
```

Make the SVG dots vertical (taller than wide) — change from 6-dot 2×3 grid to a vertical 1×3 dot strip.

Remove `padding-right: 2rem` from `.canvas-component-header` since the dots are no longer overlapping it.

### Ruby changes (`fang/widgets/base_widget.rb`)

Update `DRAG_HANDLE` SVG to a vertical 3-dot strip (simpler, fits the narrow right-edge strip):

```ruby
DRAG_HANDLE = '<div class="canvas-drag-handle"><svg width="6" height="18" viewBox="0 0 6 18" fill="currentColor"><circle cx="3" cy="3" r="1.5"/><circle cx="3" cy="9" r="1.5"/><circle cx="3" cy="15" r="1.5"/></svg></div>'
```

## Fix 3: Drag From Anywhere (Unless Edit-Locked)

**Problem**: Currently drag only starts from `.canvas-drag-handle`. User wants to drag from anywhere on the component (restoring old behavior), with the drag dots as a visual affordance.

### JS changes (`web/public/js/controllers/canvas_controller.js`)

**`onMouseDown`**: Remove the `dragHandle` check — if component is found and not edit-locked, start dragging:

```js
if (component) {
  this.selectComponent(component)
  // Drag from anywhere on the component (unless edit-locked)
  this.isDragging = true
  this.dragTarget = component
  // ... start drag
}
```

**`onTouchStart`**: Same change — remove dragHandle check.

Restore `cursor: grab` on `.canvas-component` in CSS (currently `cursor: default`).

## Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `web/public/css/style.css` | Move zoom to content, restyle drag handle as right-edge strip, restore grab cursor |
| `fang/widgets/base_widget.rb` | Update DRAG_HANDLE SVG to vertical 3-dot strip |
| `web/public/js/controllers/canvas_controller.js` | Remove dragHandle-only restriction on mouse/touch drag |

## Verification

1. Start server, open canvas with existing widgets
2. Drag a widget by clicking anywhere on it — should drag smoothly
3. Toggle edit lock — dragging should be disabled
4. Hover over a widget — see 3 vertical dots appear on right edge
5. Change font size via toolbar — widget should stay in place, only content scales

the drag handle is in the wrong place, should be on top bar of widget, and the drag should work only if i drag the drag handle not in the entire widget. because widgets may have buttons and clickable stuff

just need to align the handle a lil bit to the top and make 6 dots instead of 3

---

3 dots only, but the rest is nice
