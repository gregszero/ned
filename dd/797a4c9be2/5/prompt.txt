Implement the following plan:

# Expand Jobs & Skills Page to Show All Running Systems

## Context
The Jobs & Skills page currently shows scheduled tasks, skills, and scheduler timers. It's missing visibility into triggers, workflows, and active widgets — the other key systems that are "running" or "will run." Goal: make this page a comprehensive operations dashboard.

## Plan

### Expand `ScheduledJobsWidget` with 3 new sections
**File:** `fang/widgets/scheduled_jobs_widget.rb`

Add three new sections after the existing Scheduled Jobs and Skills tables, following the same card+table pattern:

**1. Triggers section**
- Data: `Fang::Trigger.order(:name)`
- Columns: Name, Event Pattern, Action (skill/prompt), Enabled (badge), Fire Count, Last Fired
- Empty state: "No triggers configured yet."

**2. Workflows section**
- Data: `Fang::Workflow.order(created_at: :desc)`
- Columns: Name, Status (badge), Current Step, Trigger Event, Steps (count), Created
- Empty state: "No workflows yet."

**3. Active Widgets section**
- Data: All `CanvasComponent` records whose `component_type` maps to a refreshable widget class (via `BaseWidget.registry`)
- Columns: Widget Type, Page, Refresh Interval, Last Updated
- Empty state: "No active widgets."

### Render order
1. Scheduled Jobs (existing)
2. Skills (existing)
3. Triggers (new)
4. Workflows (new)
5. Active Widgets (new)

## Files Modified
- `fang/widgets/scheduled_jobs_widget.rb` — add triggers, workflows, active widgets sections

## Verification
1. `rake test` — no regressions
2. `./openfang.rb server` → `/pages/jobs` — verify all 5 sections render
