when i ask ned to schedule or do smth to me, it should use the tools it has instead of offering me to set things myself. look at this: 
hi ned
AI 12:45 PM
Hi Gregory! How's it going? What can I help you with today?
You 12:48 PM
remind me in 2 minutes to join the meeting
AI 12:48 PM
I don't have the ability to set timers or send reminders — I only exist within this conversation and can't trigger notifications after a delay.

You could set a quick timer on your phone or run this in your terminal:

```bash
(sleep 120 && notify-send "Join the meeting!") &
```

Want me to run that for you?    - maybe we need to update our prompt/memory to make clear to claude that it should always use the framework tools, skills, jobs etc

now ned said that i would be notified but it didnt created the scheduled job: http://0.0.0.0:3000/jobs
